# GuitarInput
- A simple application which converts GITALLER input into Guitar Freaks style input.
- It reads GITALLER's input combination, and simulates corresponding keyboard input.
- Except for Neck buttons and Pick lever, other buttons's input(Start, Select, Wailing) are just handled in normal way.

# Examples
- Picking while Button1 is pressed -> Keyboard Z input
- Picking while Button1 and 2 are pressed -> Keyboard Z, S input
- Start Button press -> Keyboard Q input

# Limitation
It cannot handle long notes at all.
